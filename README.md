üìÅ Pulse Oximeter Hardware Project ‚Äì PCB Design in Altium

## Overview
This project involves the schematic capture, footprint creation, and PCB layout of a pulse oximeter circuit using Altium Designer. The board integrates the MAX30102 sensor module with supporting voltage regulation and communication interfaces, intended for use with the Nucleo-F303K8 development board.
